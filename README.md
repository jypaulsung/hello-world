# hello-world
Beginning of my career as a programmer (hopefully)

Today is Sunday, 04/30/2023. 
It is long overdue compared to the date I created my github account. 
Yet, from now on, I hope that I stay diligent enough to create and update my repositories regularly until I can actually proudly introduce myself as a software engineer.
